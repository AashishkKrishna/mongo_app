The mongoDB version used here is version 3.0(Windows 64 bit).

Follow these steps and everything should turn out to be pretty smooth.

1) Download MongoDB from http://mongodb.org; one compatible with 64 bit windows.
	
2) unzip the mongo binaries into a folder "C:\mongodb_server"

3) go to c: drive at the terminal and paste these commands	

md data\db
md C:\mongodb_server\log
echo logpath=C:\mongodb_server\log\mongo.log > C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg

After this, run the mongod executable at "C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe". Or else run the batch file at the root folder of this solution.

4) To install as a service, run as

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg --install

net start mongodb	

5) for stopping/removing mongodb service

net stop mongodb

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --remove
	
6) Also a good GUI tool for MongoDB is MMS(Mongo Mgmt Studio); http://www.litixsoft.de/english/mms/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For RabbitMQ installation(version 3.4.4):

	1) First, install erlang compiler; http://erlang.org

	2) Install RabbitMQ; http://rabbitmq.com

	3) Then to enable RabbitMQ management UI, run this command in RabbitMQ command prompt(source: http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) -
		rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

	4) Access the admin console at http://localhost:15672 with username and password both as "guest".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For ElasticSearch installation(version 1.4.4) - 
	
	1) ElasticSearch requires java runtime, so install latest JDK/JRE from Oracle website; http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

	2) Set "JAVA_HOME" environment variable with value; "C:\Progra~1\Java\jre7" for 64 bit machines. 
	Follow more information about it here; https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+the+JAVA_HOME+Variable+in+Windows
	
	3) Download the ElasticSearch package from http://elasticsearch.org/download, .zip one for windows.
	
	4) Unzip the file and go to the "elasticSearch_server\Bin" directory and say 

elasticsearch

	else, to install it as a service, say

service.bat install 
net start elasticsearch-service-x64

	at the command prompt.
	
	5) ElasticSearch server would be installed as a windows service. Confirm the set up by going to "http://localhost:9200".
	
	6) A good admin/monitoring tool for ElasticSearch is ElasticSearch-Head. Set it up as a plugin like this - 
	
C:\>elasticsearch_server\bin\plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head

And navigate to it at "http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/"

	7) To remove ElasticSearch service; run these commands

net stop elasticsearch-service-x64
sc delete elasticsearch-service-x64

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Redis(version 2.8.19) - 

	1) Download redis binaries from "https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases"

	2) Unzip the files into "C:\redis_server" folder
	
	3) Just run the "redis-server.exe"

	else
	
	to install as a service, run

redis-server.exe --service-install
net start redis

	4) To uninstall, run the usual commands

net stop redis
sc delete redis



	
That's it. Happy coding.

Note: Although I've been experimenting with MongoDB, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ and Redis on my personal windows machine(in a virtual box), but for production purposes it's linux that's the first class choice for all these technologies.
