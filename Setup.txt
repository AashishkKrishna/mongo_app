The mongoDB version used here is 2.6 64 bit.

Follow these steps and everything should turn out to be pretty smooth.

1) Download MongoDB from http://mongodb.org; one compatible with 64 bit windows.
	
2) unzip the mongo binaries into a folder "C:\mongodb_server"

3) go to c: drive at the terminal and paste these commands	

md data\db
md C:\mongodb_server\log
echo logpath=C:\mongodb_server\log\mongo.log > C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg

After this, run the mongod executable at "C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe"

4) To install as a service, run as

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg --install

net start mongodb	

5) for stopping/removing mongodb service

net stop mongodb

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --remove
	
6) Also a good GUI tool for MongoDB is robomongo, it's opensource and free of cost; http://robomongo.org

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For RabbitMQ installation(version is 3.3.1):

	1) First, install erlang compiler; http://erlang.org

	2) Install RabbitMQ; http://rabbitmq.com

	3) Then to enable RabbitMQ management UI, run this command in RabbitMQ command prompt(source: http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) -
		rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

	4) Access the admin console at http://localhost:15672 with username and password both as "guest".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For ElasticSearch installation(latest version 1.1.1) - 
	
	1) ElasticSearch requires java runtime, so install latest JDK/JRE from Oracle website; http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

	2) Set "JAVA_HOME" environment variable with value; "C:\Progra~1\Java\jre7" for 64 bit machines. 
	Follow more information about it here; https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+the+JAVA_HOME+Variable+in+Windows
	
	3) Download the ElasticSearch package from http://elasticsearch.org/download, .zip one for windows.
	
	4) Unzip the file and go to the "ElasticSearc\Bin" directory and say 
		service.bat install 
	at the command prompt.
	
	5) ElasticSearch server would be installed as a windows service. Confirm the set up by going to "http://localhost:9200".
	
	6) A good admin/monitoring tool for ElasticSearch is ElasticHQ; http://www.elastichq.org, also you can use sense plugin in Chrome; a developer console for ElasticSearch.
	
	
That's it. Happy coding.

Note: Although I've been experimenting with MongoDB, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ on my personal windows machine, but for production purposes it's linux that's the first choice for all these technologies.
