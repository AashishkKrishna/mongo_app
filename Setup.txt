The mongoDB version used here is 2.6rc1 64 bit.

Follow these steps and everything should turn out to be pretty smooth.

1) Download MongoDB from http://mongodb.org; one compatible with 64 bit windows.
	
2) unzip the mongo binaries into a folder "C:\mongodb_server"

3) go to c: drive at the terminal and paste these commands	

md data\db

md C:\mongodb_server\log

echo logpath=C:\mongodb_server\log\mongo.log > C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg --install

net start mongodb	

4) for stopping/removing mongodb service

net stop mongodb

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --remove
	
5) Also a good GUI tool for MongoDB is robomongo, it's opensource and free of cost; http://robomongo.org

For RabbitMQ installation:

	1) First, install erlang compiler; http://erlang.org
	2) Install RabbitMQ; http://rabbitmq.com
	3) Then to enable RabbitMQ management UI, run this command in RabbitMQ command prompt(source: http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) -
		rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
	4) Access the admin console at http://localhost:15672 with username and password both as "guest".


That's it. Happy coding.

Note: Although I've been experimenting with both MongoDB and RabbitMQ on my personal windows machine with .Net, but for production purposes it's linux that's the home for these technologies.
