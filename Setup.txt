The mongoDB version used here is 2.6rc1 64 bit.

Follow these steps and everything should turn out to be pretty smooth.

1) Download MongoDB from http://mongodb.org; one compatible with 64 bit windows.
	
2) unzip the mongo binaries into a folder "C:\mongodb_server"

3) go to c: drive at the terminal and paste these commands	

md data\db

md C:\mongodb_server\log

echo logpath=C:\mongodb_server\log\mongo.log > C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb_server\mongod.cfg --install

net start mongodb	

4) for stopping/removing mongodb service

net stop mongodb

C:\mongodb_server\bin\mongod.exe --remove
	
5) Also a good GUI tool for MongoDB is robomongo, it's opensource and free of cost; http://robomongo.org

For RabbitMQ installation:

	1) First, install erlang compiler; http://erlang.org
	2) Install RabbitMQ; http://rabbitmq.com
	3) Then to enable RabbitMQ management UI, run this command in RabbitMQ command prompt(source: http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) -
		rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
	4) Access the admin console at http://localhost:15672 with username and password both as "guest".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For ElasticSearch installation - 
	
	1) ElasticSearch requires java runtime, so install latest JDK/JRE from Oracle website; http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
	2) Set "JAVA_HOME" environment variable with value; "C:\Progra~1\Java\jre7" for 64 bit machines. 
	Follow more information about it here; https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+the+JAVA_HOME+Variable+in+Windows
	3) Download the ElasticSearch package from http://elasticsearch.org/download, .zip one for windows.
	4) Unzip the file and go to the "ElasticSearc\Bin" directory and say 
		elasticsearch.bat install 
	at the command prompt.
	5) ElasticSearch server would be installed as a windows service. Confirm the set up by going to "http://localhost:9200".
	
	
That's it. Happy coding.

Note: Although I've been experimenting with MongoDB, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ on my personal windows virtual machine hosted on Ubuntu, but for production purposes it's linux that's the first choice for all these technologies.
